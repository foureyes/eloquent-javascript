"% The Book of Programming\n" + 
"\n" + 
"%% The Two Aspects\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort,\n" + 
"it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and\n" + 
"regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The\n" + 
"essence stays invisibly below.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"When the creators built the machine, they put in the processor and the\n" + 
"memory. From these arise the two aspects of the program.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"The aspect of the processor is the active substance. It is called\n" + 
"Control. The aspect of the memory is the passive substance. It is\n" + 
"called Data.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Data is made of merely bits, yet it takes complex forms. Control\n" + 
"consists only of simple instructions, yet it performs difficult\n" + 
"tasks. From the small and trivial, the large and complex arise.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"The program source is Data. Control arises from it. The Control\n" + 
"proceeds to create new Data. The one is born from the other, the\n" + 
"other is useless without the one. This is the harmonious cycle of\n" + 
"Data and Control.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Of themselves, Data and Control are without structure. The programmers\n" + 
"of old moulded their programs out of this raw substance. Over time,\n" + 
"the amorphous Data has crystallised into data types, and the chaotic\n" + 
"Control was restricted into control structures and functions.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"%% Short Sayings\n" + 
"\n" + 
"When a student asked Fu-Tzu about the nature of the cycle of Data and\n" + 
"Control, Fu-Tzu replied 'Think of a compiler, compiling itself.'\n" + 
"\n" + 
"A student asked 'The programmers of old used only simple machines and\n" + 
"no programming languages, yet they made beautiful programs. Why do we\n" + 
"use complicated machines and programming languages?'. Fu-Tzu replied\n" + 
"'The builders of old used only sticks and clay, yet they made\n" + 
"beautiful huts.'\n" + 
"\n" + 
"A hermit spent ten years writing a program. 'My program can compute\n" + 
"the motion of the stars on a 286-computer running MS DOS', he proudly\n" + 
"announced. 'Nobody owns a 286-computer or uses MS DOS anymore.',\n" + 
"Fu-Tzu responded.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Fu-Tzu had written a small program that was full of global state and\n" + 
"dubious shortcuts. Reading it, a student asked 'You warned us against\n" + 
"these techniques, yet I find them in your program. How can this be?'\n" + 
"Fu-Tzu said 'There is no need to fetch a water hose when the house is\n" + 
"not on fire.'{This is not to be read as an encouragement of sloppy\n" + 
"programming, but rather as a warning against neurotic adherence to\n" + 
"rules of thumb.}\n" + 
"\n" + 
"%% Wisdom\n" + 
"\n" + 
"A student was complaining about digital numbers. 'When I take the root\n" + 
"of two and then square it again, the result is already inaccurate!'.\n" + 
"Overhearing him, Fu-Tzu laughed. 'Here is a sheet of paper. Write down\n" + 
"the precise value of the square root of two for me.'\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Fu-Tzu said 'When you cut against the grain of the wood, much strength\n" + 
"is needed. When you program against the grain of a problem, much code\n" + 
"is needed.'\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest\n" + 
"programs. 'Two-hundred thousand lines', said Tzu-li, 'not counting\n" + 
"comments!'. 'Psah', said Tzu-ssu, 'mine is almost a *million* lines\n" + 
"already.' Fu-Tzu said 'My best program has five hundred lines.'\n" + 
"Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"A student had been sitting motionless behind his computer for hours,\n" + 
"frowning darkly. He was trying to write a beautiful solution to a\n" + 
"difficult problem, but could not find the right approach. Fu-Tzu hit\n" + 
"him on the back of his head and shouted '*Type something!*' The student\n" + 
"started writing an ugly solution. After he had finished, he suddenly\n" + 
"understood the beautiful solution.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"%% Progression\n" + 
"\n" + 
"A beginning programmer writes his programs like an ant builds her\n" + 
"hill, one piece at a time, without thought for the bigger structure.\n" + 
"His programs will be like loose sand. They may stand for a while, but\n" + 
"growing too big they fall apart{Referring to the danger of internal\n" + 
"inconsistency and duplicated structure in unorganised code.}.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Realising this problem, the programmer will start to spend a lot of\n" + 
"time thinking about structure. His programs will be rigidly\n" + 
"structured, like rock sculptures. They are solid, but when they must\n" + 
"change, violence must be done to them{Referring to the fact that\n" + 
"structure tends to put restrictions on the evolution of a program.}.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"The master programmer knows when to apply structure and when to leave\n" + 
"things in their simple form. His programs are like clay, solid yet\n" + 
"malleable.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"%% Language\n" + 
"\n" + 
"When a programming language is created, it is given syntax and\n" + 
"semantics. The syntax describes the form of the program, the semantics\n" + 
"describe the function. When the syntax is beautiful and the semantics\n" + 
"are clear, the program will be like a stately tree. When the syntax is\n" + 
"clumsy and the semantics confusing, the program will be like a bramble\n" + 
"bush.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Tzu-ssu was asked to write a program in the language called Java,\n" + 
"which takes a very primitive approach to functions. Every morning, as\n" + 
"he sat down in front of his computer, he started complaining. All day\n" + 
"he cursed, blaming the language for all that went wrong. Fu-Tzu\n" + 
"listened for a while, and then reproached him, saying 'Every language\n" + 
"has its own way. Follow its form, do not try to program as if you\n" + 
"were using another language.'\n";
